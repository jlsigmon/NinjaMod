# HOW TO USE:
1. Add CooldownButton.cs to your project
2. Get an image for your button in .png format (100 x 100 pixels is recommended) and add it to the Project resources (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKKNwK0ysPY) as a file (NOT AS AN IMAGE!!!).
3. Add Example.cs to your project, change the namespace, change the cooldown/etc, and add code as needed.
